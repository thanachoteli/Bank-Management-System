A bank management system in C++ is a beginner's project that is great for students. It is made such that it helps users manage their bank accounts. It allows users to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account details. This project suits students who want to learn basic programming concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in C++ and test their knowledge. It’s a great learning example for handling user input, managing account transactions, and using C++ classes and objects. 
The main features of the banking application include:

1. Account Creation – Users can open a new bank account by providing their name, account number, and an initial deposit.
2. Deposit Money – Users can add money to their account.
3. Withdraw Money – Users can withdraw money if they have enough balance.
4. Check Account Details – Users can view their account number, holder name, and balance.

Process Required 
To build this bank management system in C++, you need to understand several programming concepts:
1. Library Functions: We use standard C++ libraries like <iostream> for input-output operations and <vector> to store multiple bank accounts.
2. Memory Management: The data is stored in runtime memory. Therefore, efficient memory handling is required. We use vectors instead of raw arrays for dynamic data storage.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) – The project is built using classes and objects. A class BankAccount stores account details and functions like deposit(), withdraw(), and displayAccount().
4. Control Structures: The program uses loops while and for, decision-making statements (if-else), and functions for better code organisation.
5. Error Handling: The project includes basic checks like preventing negative deposits, ensuring sufficient balance for withdrawals, and validating account numbers.

Algorithm 
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Display Menu Options
Show the user options:
1. Create Account
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Display Account Details
5. Exit
Step 3: Take User Input for Choice
1. Read the user's choice.
Step 4: Perform Actions Based on Choice
Case 1: Create Account
1. Ask the user for Name, Account Number, and Initial Balance.
2. Create a new BankAccount object and store it in a list.
3. Confirm account creation.
4. 
Case 2: Deposit Money
1. Ask the user for Account Number and Deposit Amount.
2. Search for the account in the list.
3. If found, add the amount to the balance and confirm the deposit.
4. If not found, display an error message.

Case 3: Withdraw Money
1. Ask the user for the Account Number and Withdrawal Amount.
2. Search for the account in the list.
3. If found, check if the balance is sufficient.
If yes, deduct the amount and confirm the withdrawal.
If no, display an insufficient balance message.
4. If the account is not found, display an error message.

Case 4: Display Account Details

1. Ask the user for the Account Number.

2. Search for the account in the list.

3. If found, display the account holder's name, account number, and balance.

4. If not found, display an error message.

Case 5: Exit Program

1. Display a thank-you message.

2. Terminate the program.

Step 5: Repeat Until User Chooses to Exit

Step 6: End
